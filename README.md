ohMe
=========

A small node module providing utility methods to search JavaScript objects by key or value. Can be very handy with large shared objects and variable search values.

### Installation

  npm install ohme --save

### Usage

Simply reqiure ohme on the base page and its ready to use.
```sh
  const ohme = require('ohme');
  const phoneListObj = {
    tina: '555-1212',
    sam: '444-4040',
    jane: '777-1212'
  }
```
Using the above phoneList object to get the phone number (value) by a person (key) use this code:
```sh
  const phone = ohme.getVal(phoneListObj, 'jane')   //returns '777-1212'
```

Using the above phoneList object to get the person (key) by a phone number (value) use this code:
```sh
  const phone = ohme.getVal(phoneListObj, '777-1212')   //returns 'jane'
```
### Tests
  npm test
